# ArgoCD

The `ArgoCD` resource is a Kubernetes Custom Resource (CRD) that describes the desired state for a given Argo CD 
cluster and allows for the configuration of the components that make up an Argo CD cluster.

When the Argo CD Operator sees a new ArgoCD resource, the components are provisioned using Kubernetes resources and 
managed by the operator. When something changes on an existing ArgoCD resource, the operator works to reconfigure the 
cluster to ensure the actual state of the cluster matches the desired state. 

The ArgoCD Custom Resource consists of the following properties.
