## Overview

Dex can be used to delegate authentication to external identity providers like GitHub, SAML and others. SSO configuration of Argo CD requires updating the Argo CD CR with [Dex connector](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/) settings.

## Dex OpenShift OAuth Connector

The below section describes how to configure Argo CD SSO using OpenShift connector as an example. Dex makes use of the users and groups defined within OpenShift by querying the platform provided OAuth server.

The `openShiftOAuth` property can be used to trigger the operator to auto configure the built-in OpenShift OAuth server. The `groups` property is used to mandate users to be part of one or all the groups in the groups list. The RBAC `Policy` property is used to give the admin role in the Argo CD cluster to users in the OpenShift `cluster-admins` group.

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: openshift-oauth
spec:
  sso:
    provider: dex
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
      groups:
      - default
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: 'role:readonly'
    policy: |
      g, cluster-admins, role:admin
    scopes: '[groups]'
```

#### Role Mappings

To have a specific user be properly atrributed with the `role:admin` upon SSO through Openshift, the user needs to be in a **group** with the `cluster-admin` role added. If the user only has a direct `ClusterRoleBinding` to the Openshift role for `cluster-admin`, the Argo CD role will not map.

A quick fix will be to create a group named `cluster-admins` group, add the user to the group and then apply the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole to the group.

```txt
oc adm groups new cluster-admins
oc adm groups add-users cluster-admins USER
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin cluster-admins
```

## Dex GitHub Connector

The below section describes how to configure Argo CD SSO using GitHub (OAuth2) as an example, but the steps should be similar for other identity providers.

1. Register the application in the identity provider as explained [here](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/user-management/#1-register-the-application-in-the-identity-provider).

2. Update the Argo CD CR.

In the `dex.config` key, add the github connector to the connectors sub field. See the Dex [GitHub connector documentation](https://github.com/dexidp/website/blob/main/content/docs/connectors/github.md) for explanation of the fields. A minimal config should populate the clientID, clientSecret generated in Step 1.
You will very likely want to restrict logins to one or more GitHub organization. In the
`connectors.config.orgs` list, add one or more GitHub organizations. Any member of the org will then be able to login to Argo CD to perform management tasks.

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: openshift-oauth
spec:
  sso:
    provider: dex
    dex:
      config: |
        connectors:
          # GitHub example
          - type: github
            id: github
            name: GitHub
            config:
              clientID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
              clientSecret: $dex.github.clientSecret # Alternatively $<some_K8S_secret>:dex.github.clientSecret
              orgs:
              - name: dummy-org
```

## Install/Uninstall DEX

Dex can be enabled by setting `.spec.sso.provider` to `dex` and supplying a non-empty `.spec.sso.dex` section within the Argo CD custom resource. For example: 

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: example-argocd
  labels:
    example: openshift-oauth
spec:
  sso:
    provider: dex
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
```
Dex can be uninstalled by either deleting the `.spec.sso` field from the Argo CD custom resource, or setting `.spec.sso.provider` to an SSO provider other than dex. Doing so would trigger the removal of all dex related resources created by the operator.

**NOTE:** `.spec.sso.dex` is required and must not be empty if `spec.sso.provider` is set to dex.

**NOTE:** The `DISABLE_DEX` environment variable is no longer supported for enabling/disabling dex.
